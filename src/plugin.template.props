pluginDescription=A regulon consists of a transcription factor (TF) and its direct transcriptional targets, which contain common TF binding sites in their cis-regulatory control elements.<p>The iRegulon plugin allows you to identify regulons using motif discovery in an existing network or in a set of co-regulated genes.<br><ul type=disc><li>Motif discovery is performed in proximal and distal sequences, across ten vertebrate genomes, using more than six thousand candidate motifs (position weight matrices or PWMs).</li><li>The output of iRegulon is a list of enriched motifs, alongside with candidate transcription factors. The Motif2TF associations are based on PWM annotation, the use of TF homology, and of motif similarity.</li><li>New networks can be automatically generated based on the predicted TF-target interactions.</li><li>The iRegulon plugin can also be used to query high-confidence target genes predicted from the systematic analysis of thousands of cancer gene signatures.</li></ul><a href="@websiteUrl@">@websiteUrl@</a></p>
