pluginDescription=<p>A regulon consists of a transcription factor (TF) and its direct transcriptional targets, which contain common TF binding sites in their cis-regulatory control elements.</p><p>The <a href="@websiteUrl@">iRegulon plugin</a> allows you to identify regulons using motif and track discovery in an existing network or in a set of co-regulated genes.</p><ul type=disc><li>Motif discovery is performed in proximal and distal sequences, across ten vertebrate genomes, using nearly ten thousand candidate motifs (position weight matrices or PWMs).</li><li>Track discovery allows detecting TFs using gene rankings according to the highest ChIP peak within the regulatory space. This version uses more than one thousand ChIP-Seq tracks.</li><li>The output of iRegulon is a list of enriched motifs/tracks, alongside with candidate transcription factors. The Motif2TF associations are based on PWM annotation, the use of TF homology, and of motif similarity.</li><li>New networks can be automatically generated based on the predicted TF-target interactions.</li><li>The iRegulon plugin can also be used to query a TF-targets database made of high-confidence target genes predicted from the systematic analysis of thousands of cancer gene signatures.</li><li>Supported organisms are human, mouse and fly.</li></ul><p><i>A full version of the plugin including TRANSFAC Professional motifs is provided from the website </i><a href="@downloadUrl@">@downloadUrl@</a><i> (To download the TRANSFAC PRO version, the user will need to have a valid subscription to TRANSFAC Professional).</i></p>
